0x0A. C - argc, argv
In the project, we learn how to receive arguments from the commandline into our main() function.

The declaration of main() now looks like this:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ...
}
int argc
This holds the number of arguments passed to your program.

NOTE: It also counts the name of the program along with the number of arguments passed.

You'll see more on this shortly.

char *argv[]
This holds a list of all the argument passed to your program, including the name of the program.

Imagine we have a program named listfiles, we can pass filenames (arguments) to the program by running it like this:

./listfiles file1 file2 file3
Now, inside the main() function of the program...

argc = 4

argv = {"./listfiles", "file1", "file2", "file3"}

Look at the tasks below to gain more insight into how you can use these

0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to
Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
You should not remove the path before the name of the program

1. Silence is argument carried out by other means
Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

Your program should print a number, followed by a new line


2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

All arguments should be printed, including the first one
Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line


3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument
Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1


4. To infinity and beyond
Print the result, followed by a new line
If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
you can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int


5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change
Write a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

Usage: ./change cents
where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back
if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program
If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line
You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent
