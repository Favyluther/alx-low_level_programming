Task 0.
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.

Task 1.
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task

Task 2.
A program prints the largest of three integers.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Task 3.
A program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
